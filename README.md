# MMED2025-Rabies-Group-Project
Topic: Accelerating Rabies Elimination

Group members: Rachel, Zizipo, Faith, Patience, Alice, Omar

Faculty: Mutono and Martha

Research question: 
1. What level of vaccination coverage is required to eliminate rabies transmission in the domestic dog population in Tanzania by 2030?
2. How does the effectiveness of continuous dog rabies vaccination compare to periodic mass vaccination campaigns in reducing rabies incidence in Tanzania?

P- Domestic dog population in Tanzania

I- Rabies vaccination through continuous or periodic campaigns

C- Current vaccination coverage (5%)

O- Elimination (reduction to zero) of rabies incidence by 2030

Goals:

By the end of Day 9, we will have finalised a research question, chosen our parameter values, and debugged our deterministic model.

Then, we will include variations in vaccination delivery timing.
