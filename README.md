# MMED2025-Rabies-Group-Project
Topic: Accelerating Rabies Elimination

Group members: Rachel, Zizipo, Faith, Patience, Alice, Omar

Faculty: Mutono and Martha

Research question: 
What is an adequate vaccination coverage goal for both continuous vaccination and discrete vaccination campaigns in order to reduce the incidence of rabies in the dog population in Tanzania to zero by 2030?

How does vaccination coverage and frequency impact the achievability of eliminating dog-mediated human rabies by 2030?

P- Domestic dog population in Tanzania

I- 70% vaccination with continuous or discrete vaccinations

C- Status quo of 5% vaccination coverage

O- Reduction of incidence to zero

By the end of Day 9, we will have a finalised research question, have chosen our parameters and debugged our deterministic model.

Then, we will include the variation of vaccination delivery timing.
