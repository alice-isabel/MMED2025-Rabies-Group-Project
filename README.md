# MMED2025-Rabies-Group-Project
Topic: Accelerating Rabies Elimination

Group members: Rachel, Zizipo, Faith, Patience, Alice, Omar

Faculty: Mutono and Martha

Research question: 
1. What is an adequate vaccination coverage goal to reduce the incidence of rabies in the dog population in Tanzania to zero by 2030?
2. What is the impact of continuous vaccination as opposed to periodic vaccination campaigns?

P- Domestic dog population in Tanzania

I- Vaccination with continuous or periodic vaccinations

C- Status quo of 5% vaccination coverage

O- Reduction of incidence to zero by 2030

Goals:

By the end of Day 9, we will have a finalised research question, have chosen our parameter values and debugged our deterministic model.

Then, we will include the variation of vaccination delivery timing.
